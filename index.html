    Configuration of Git: open cmd and give following commands  
    * git config --global user.name "abhi5564"
    * git config --global user.email "abhishek1801k@gmail.com"
    * git --cofig --list through this command wwe can check all credentials list that we have set in point 1 nd 2.
    
     
Steps to get a copy of the project from git(Remote) to our system(Local):
        
        1. Make a new repo with name "git-webdev" on github with readme.md file included. Before this we need to configure git with 
        vs code so that that the code we are pushing or pulling have right credentials for paticular repos.
        * Make a folder "gitdemo" on ur system and open with the vscode where we will take all pullls from the github project.
        * To clone(get a copy of project) a project give command "git clone https-link=https://github.com/abhi5564/git-webdev.git"
        * We will see a new folder "git-webdev" inside "gitdemo" so to change directory  to "cd git-webdev" to perform action on the
          current pulled repo git-webdev.
        * Make changes in readme.md (kumarr) and add new file index.html
        * to get all list of files in git-webdev "ls -a" it will give readme.md and .git file(hidden)  and "git status" will give the 
          status like staged, commit req, or up to date or not. here the changes are not staged for readme.md, and untracked for 
          index.html so we need to add and commit it. 
                {4 types of stages 
                   untracked:new files that git did'nt tracked
                   modified: changed
                   staged: files are ready to be comitted
                   unmodified: unchanged}
        * add changes: "git add index.html" or "git add ." for adding all files  and then 
          Commit Changes: "git commit -m some meaningful messages:added new para "   After this all Changes are committed an added
          but our vs code is one step ahead by github by 1, so we need to push changes to git hub also
        * Push: "git push origin main"  and it's done.
